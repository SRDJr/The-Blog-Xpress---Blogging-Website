    <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">NEET Scam 2024: A Blow to India's Medical Education Integrity</h2>
    <p class="blog-post-meta">June 15, 2024 by <a href="#">SRD Junior</a></p>
  
    <p>The NEET 2024 examination has been marred by controversy, casting a shadow over India's medical education system. Reports of paper leaks, arrests, and irregularities have raised serious questions about the integrity and fairness of the exam.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>In a shocking turn of events, a paper leak in Patna, Bihar, led to nearly 13 arrests. Students involved admitted that racketeers had contacted them, offering leaked exam papers and answers for a hefty sum of 30 lakhs per student. Despite the discovery, the leaked paper was burned and could not be matched with the original exam paper.</p>
    
    <h2>Irregularities and Mismanagement</h2>
    <p>The NEET 2024 exam saw poor conduct in several centers. Many students reported not receiving the proper allotted time for the exam. Following these complaints, for the first time in NEET history, grace marks were awarded. However, there was no transparency regarding the distribution of these grace marks—who received them, how many were awarded, and on what basis. This decision sparked debate over whether compensating lost time would have been a fairer solution than awarding grace marks.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Discrepancies in Scorecards</h3>
    <p>Many students reported discrepancies between their scorecards and the scores they calculated from their OMR sheets and the official answer key. This discrepancy further eroded trust in the National Testing Agency (NTA), which oversees the exam. The NTA's lack of transparency and poor communication with affected students and educators has only fueled the dissatisfaction.</p>
    
    <h3>Unexpected Rank Shifts</h3>
    <p>Another point of contention was the sudden increase in ranks relative to marks. This abrupt change left both students and teachers stunned. Additionally, an unprecedented number of students, 67 to be precise, scored a perfect 720 marks. Even though they all achieved AIR 1, they faced the harsh reality that not all could secure a spot at AIIMS Delhi due to limited seats.</p>

    <h3>Marks Vs Rank: Year Wise Analysis</h3>
    <p>This shows how ranks have been dropped this year as compared to previous years:</p>

    <h2>Impact on Future Doctors</h2>
    <p>This scandal has significant implications. The NEET exam is crucial for aspiring medical students, and such irregularities undermine the credibility of the selection process, potentially affecting the future of India's healthcare system. The trust in NTA, the body responsible for conducting these exams, has been severely damaged, raising concerns about the future conduct of the exam.</p>
    
    <h3>Calls for Reform</h3>

Stakeholders are calling for stricter security measures, better management practices, and a more transparent system to handle such situations. Many students and teachers had demanded for a <em>Re-NEET</em> this year following these complications.</p>
